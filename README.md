# DSA Practice – Striver's SDE Sheet

This repository contains my personal solutions and notes based on the [Striver's SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) curated by **Raj Vikramaditya (Striver)**.

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to track my learning progress while practicing Data Structures and Algorithms using the problems listed in the Striver Sheet. All solutions here are written by me after understanding the problems, and may include explanations, edge cases, or alternative approaches.

## 🙏 Credits

All problem listings, categories, and structured progression are based on the original [Striver’s SDE Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/).

Full credit goes to **Striver (Raj Vikramaditya)** for curating and structuring this sheet as a roadmap for DSA preparation.
