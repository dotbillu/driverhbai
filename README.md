## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional installations required

### Quick Start
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/driver-a2z-dsa-sheet.git
   cd driver-a2z-dsa-sheet
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Or simply open index.html in your browser
   ```

3. **Start Learning**
   - Navigate through topics using the sidebar
   - Click on problem links to access solutions
   - Track your progress as you complete problems
   - Use mark all/reset buttons for bulk operations

## üí° Usage Tips

### Effective Learning Strategy:
1. **Follow the Sequential Order**: Topics are arranged in logical progression
2. **Complete Categories**: Finish entire categories before moving on
3. **Practice Regularly**: Consistent daily practice yields best results
4. **Review Completed Problems**: Revisit solved problems periodically
5. **Use Both Platforms**: Compare solutions on both GFG and LeetCode

### Progress Management:
- **Green indicators**: Completed problems/categories
- **Yellow indicators**: Partially completed sections
- **Progress badges**: Quick overview in navigation sidebar
- **Reset functionality**: Start fresh when needed

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Built With:
- **HTML5** - Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Interactive functionality
- **Chart.js** - Progress visualization
- **Local Storage** - Progress persistence

### Browser Compatibility:
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## üì± Responsive Design

The platform is fully responsive and optimized for:
- **Desktop**: Full-featured experience with sidebar navigation

    --text-primary: #e2e8f0;
    /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Adding New Problems:
1. Update the `steps` array in `main.js`
2. Add category mappings in `categories` object
3. Define question ranges in `categoryRanges`
